# Programming Collective Intelligence refactored and annotated example code

Toby Segaran's [Programming Collective Intelligence](https://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596529321/),
released originally in 2007, is still a valuable text, providing a good, dense
introductory overview of the field of machine learning and statistics, with a
fast pace and high signal to noise ratio. Its only problem is that the provided
examples are sometimes a bit hard to follow, to say the least, thanks to the
many typos, cryptic and/or inconsistent variable names, magic numbers, the lack
of good formatting, and the usage of Python 2 of course.

My intention is somewhere around halfway between reworking chapters entirely and
just dumping a big pile of code snippets here - in general, I aimed for an easy
to follow walkthrough, commenting and/or refactoring everything that was not
100% obvious after reading the text and staring at the code for a few seconds,
so that these cleaned-up examples can be used together with the book, allowing
you to focus more on the core concepts. This is also a good excuse to refresh my
Python skills, and catch up with the latest features - you might be able to pick
up some useful tips along the way too.

For now, the very last chapter on genetic programming is available. Depending on
my whim, chapter 5 (Optimization) and 6 (Document Filtering) are probable next
candidates for a similar treatment.

Note: The original code examples from the book can be found on GitHub in various
different repositories.
